- I like it
- Overall, most people probably aren't going to be doing this to practice debating
- They're going to do it to a) meet people b) have fun and/or c) build confidence by practicing talking to strangers
- Rebranding as a more generic thing (like Omegle) would be good and probably beneficial
- Add planning for how you are going to enter room/skip/etc
- More mini games -- besides just debate, you cave like heads up or something, 20 questions, etc
- This could be more of a generic meeting people with games app instead of just a debate app
- just look at like Omegle basically
