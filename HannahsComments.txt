- In general, I think this is a really great game idea. I love the breadbasket guys, 
and ik a lot of ppl who would play this game.

- I think the app interface should be something similar to the imposter app rather than heads up

- maybe consider sorting players by more specific age categories, specificslly when playing online,
for both safety and fairness purposes

- I'm a little bit confused about how voting would work if it's just a 2 player game.
