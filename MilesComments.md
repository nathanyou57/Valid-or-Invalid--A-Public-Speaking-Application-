What i'm noticing:

In person game - two kids debate. Kinda like Heads Up
Possibly, could build an online varient with crowd and stuff like Omegle

Feedback:

I think this idea is great! I like the educational aspect of making people better at public speaking while also being something you can play with your friends. I especially like how the online aspect can have people playing Valid or Invalid with a virtual audience. 

In general, I think it might be cool to not have the outcome shown to the audience before the speakers start. Then, the speaker gives their speech and then the goal is to get the audience to say yes or no, based on what you were assigned.I think a reward system for this would be great, like a leaderboard for the most persuasive people or the hottest topics, where people are split.

Regarding laws, it might be a good idea to separate users based on age category for safety purposes. Also, it'll make sure that arguments with similar levels of complexity are being posed against each other. Wouldn't want an 18 year old destroying a 12 year old.
