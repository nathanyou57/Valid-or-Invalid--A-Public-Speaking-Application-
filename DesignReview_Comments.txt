Design Review Guidelines:
1. Conduct design reviews for the 3 projects with the highest financial influence.
   - Ensure collaborator status on the project accounts (ask to be added or fork if absent).
   - Add collaborators for those wishing to work on the project.
2. Follow the design review documentation from the previous cycle.
3. Focus on additional features for user experience and overall application design.

Design Review Comments: Valid or Invalid

This is a great concept, especially taking the Bread Basket game and making it digital. I think it has a lot of potential for building confidence in public speaking. Here are some thoughts on features and improvements:

New Feature Ideas:
- Add daily debate topic notifications and streak tracking to keep people coming back.
- Sharing to TikTok or Instagram with "Valid" or "Invalid" overlays—this would be great for growth.
- Weekly leaderboards for top debaters and most controversial topics.
- A "Duet mode" where people can record a response to an existing argument.
- Challenges where you can battle friends or teams in a debate.

Debate & Recording Tools:
- Argument templates for beginners (like "The main problem is..." or "Consider this...") to help them structure their thoughts.
- A private practice mode where you can record and watch yourself before posting publicly.
- A timer overlay (30s, 60s, or 2min) to keep speeches concise.
- A "See both sides" rule: you have to watch the opposing argument before you're allowed to vote.

AI & Coaching:
- Auto-transcription that highlights filler words like "um," "like," and "uh."
- Feedback on speech pace and pronunciation.
- An "argument quality" score based on logic and persuasiveness.
- AI-generated counter-arguments to help people practice defending their points.

UI/UX & Gamification:
- XP points, levels, and badges to make it feel more like a game (like Duolingo).
- A dashboard on the profile for win/loss ratios and debate stats.
- Interactive onboarding with a simple starter topic like "Is a hot dog a sandwich?"
- A clean recording screen with just the topic, a big record button, and a countdown.
- Swipe-based voting (left for invalid, right for valid) like Tinder, with poll results shown after.

Technical & Business side:
- Stick with React Native or Flutter for mobile-first cross-platform support.
- Use Firebase for real-time updates and auth.
- Integrate AssemblyAI or GPT for the transcription and argument analysis.
- Needs video compression and a CDN for fast loading.
- Freemium model: maybe 3 debates a day for free, and a premium tier for unlimited access and advanced stats.

Risks to watch out for:
- Moderation is key—need AI flagging for hate speech and a solid reporting system.
- For people who are shy, the private practice mode and beginner-friendly topics will help a lot.
- Use tags for different types of topics (Serious, Casual, Comedy) so people know what they're getting into.

Overall, if you focus on keeping the barrier to entry low and making it feel like a game, this could be huge. Really looking forward to seeing the next version!
